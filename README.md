### Reflections and Comments

- How did this go, overall?
  - This assignment was fairly straightforward
- What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
  - Question about how the "Margin" reacted differently in the Reset file vs. the Styles File
- How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
  - It took me a couple of hours to complete. I originally thought it would only take around an hour.
